HTML and CSS projects

In this repository are the projects that I worked on for the HTML and CSS course provided by the Tech Academy.

Projects:

Lady Maria Site
Mechanical Keyboard Site

Lady Maria Site

This site shows any example of a profile page of the Bloodborne character, Lady Maria. It is styled using CSS and was built using code from Bootsrap4.


Mechanical Keyboard Site

This is an example of a mechanical keyboard consulting agent contact page. I made it using CSS and html. It features a navbar and separate sections available for viewing with functioning navigation.
