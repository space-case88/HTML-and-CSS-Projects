            <p>According to both her equipment and her weapon, Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower was a citizen of Cainhurst and is a distant relative to Queen Annalise. She was also one of the first hunters to join the nightly hunt. She studied under Gehrman, the First Hunter, whom Maria had admired, unknowing of his curious mania towards her. Despite being a citizen of Cainhurst, where they relished in extravagant uses of blood, she favored her Rakuyo, which instead required dexterity and skill rather to wield effectively.</p>

            <p>At some point during her time as a hunter, Maria partook in the excursion by Byrgenwerth scholars to the Fishing Hamlet, having learned of the mutations the villagers had undergone in the presence of Kos, a Great One whose corpse had washed ashore near the village. The mission would take its toll on Maria's morals, as she, alongside the scholars and other hunters, had participated in the hunting and mutilation of the villagers, and the violation of Kos's body. </p>

            <p>It is unclear what exactly Maria and the other old hunters did to Kos's body, but it can be inferred it was done to harvest the Great One's eldritch blood. Nonetheless, it was a sacrilegious action for which Maria and the other old hunters involved would suffer for eternally as they became imprisoned in the Hunter's Nightmare. At some point, likely out of guilt for her actions at the Fishing Hamlet, Maria forfeited her beloved Rakuyo, tossing it down a well when she could "no longer stomach it", supposedly killing herself as well. Her spirit was then pulled into the Hunter's Nightmare. </p>

            <p>Even after she disappeared, Gehrman remained obsessed with her. To keep himself company, Gehrman created a Doll to Maria's likeness, faithful to the latter's appearance down to her tall height and facial features. However, Gehrman grew to be indifferent towards the Doll, likely due to her lacking Maria's personality. </p>
